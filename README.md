# vdW_HS_Li_intercalation
List of file handling automation scripts written in python3 created by me to ease my workflow while working on 2D vdW heterostructure based anode material for Li-ion batteries. Designed to work with _Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package_ (VASP).

Li_grid.py - used for adding a grid of Li atoms dispersed in between the layers of vdW heterostructure. Current form is only working for my personal graphene-phosphorene 4-layer heterostructure. Will be improved to take inputs from other scripts so that it can be generalized to all heterostructures.
Layer_detect.py - uused to identify the layers and the dimensions of the interlayer region available for intercalation
